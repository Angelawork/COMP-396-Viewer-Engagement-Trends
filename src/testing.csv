xwtnypAIW3I,Republicans Nominate Steve Scalise for US House Speaker | VOANews,Voice of America,2940000,65210,564,144,"['DATELINE BRADENTON FLORIDA U S A\r<br>\r<br>10/17/2023 6:32PM NEW YORK TIME\r<br>\r<br>                                          S P E A K E R  D O N A L D  J O H N  T R U M P \r<br>\r<br>THE WORLD IS ON FIRE DONALD JOHN TRUMP MUST BE MADE SPEAKER OF THE U S HOUSE!\r<br>\r<br>THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OVERWHELMINGLY WANT DONALD JOHN TRUMP AS SPEAKER!\r<br>WILL THE 118TH CONGRESS GIVE THE AMERICAN U S CITIZENS WHAT THEY\r<br>CLEARLY NOT ONLY WANT BUT HAVE DEMANDED? BASED ON THE MOUNTAINS OF\r<br>COMMENTS THAT CAME IN WITH THE VOTE RESULTS; I TRULY BELIEVE THAT OUR\r<br>GROUP OF POLL COUNTERS THINK OR KNOW IF THE PEOPLE DO NOT GET DONALD\r<br>JOHN TRUMP AS THE NEXT SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE; IT WILL BECOME THE LAND\r<br>OF PRIMARIES, AS A LOT OF THE REPUBLICAN HOUSE MEMBERS WILL FRANKLY\r<br>PUT, BE VOTED OUT OF OFFICE. WE BELIEVE THIS WILL MAKE OR BREAK, NO,\r<br>END POLITICAL CAREERS!\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>CONTINUED RESULTS: Who would you vote for SPEAKER?\r<br>\r<br>FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP\r<br>\r<br>96%\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>JICM JORDAN\r<br>\r<br> 4%\r<br>\r<br> Refresh ·\r<br> 199 votes\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP\r<br>\r<br>67%\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>JIM JORDAN\r<br>\r<br>33%\r<br>\r<br>Refresh\r<br>204 votes\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP\r<br>\r<br>88%\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>JIM JORDAN\r<br>\r<br>12%\r<br>\r<br>Refresh\r<br>81 votes\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>FORMER PRESIDENT DONALD JOHN TRUMP\r<br>\r<br>25%\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>JIM JORDAN\r<br>\r<br>75%\r<br>\r<br>Refresh\r<br>25 votes\r<br>\r<br>PART 1. Matt Gaetz is the only one who stood up for what was right on\r<br>day 1. He originally nominated President Trump for Speaker. Next, he\r<br>reinstated the standard of 1 Rep Recall put in place by Thomas\r<br>Jefferson changed by Pelosi. Next when he proved McCarthy was &quot;Swamp&quot;\r<br>he had the courage to pull the trigger and do the right thing. He set\r<br>the stage to make things right!\r<br>\r<br> Herbert Eric Stephens\r<br>\r<br>PART 2. There can not be 1 Republican in the House that does not know\r<br>and believe deep within their very own soul that Donald John Trump did\r<br>not win the 2020 election and had it stolen by the Democrats. The\r<br>American People I believe call on Jim Jordan, &amp; Steve Scalise and any\r<br>other Republican that is considering anyone other than Donald John\r<br>Trump as Speaker of the House Mr. McCarthy&#39;s true and only choice for\r<br>replacement; if anyone else seeks the position, they are no better\r<br>than the Democrats who stole Mr. Trump&#39;s Opportunity to Govern this\r<br>great nation. Look to your very own soul and appeal to your inner\r<br>Angles, and bring forth the true righteousness that this nation\r<br>deserves. I will show you the path that Mr. Gaetz has made possible.\r<br>\r<br>Herbert Eric Stephens\r<br>\r<br>PART 3. When Mr. Trump is made Speaker, he will fast track the\r<br>impeachments of Joe Biden, and Kamala Harris. Both will be impeached\r<br>based on the violation of the Constitution on the sole charge of not\r<br>stopping the invasion on the southern border. The 17 proposed mile\r<br>wall is far too little and oh so late. The Democrats will in fact in\r<br>the Senate vote to remove both after they are in fact impeached. How\r<br>do I know this? Because it always seems that Texas stands tall in the\r<br>annals of history and will do so in this quest to restore these United\r<br>States to their rightful leadership, and way of legal life.\r<br>\r<br> Herbert Eric Stephens\r<br>\r<br> PART 4. Texas over the next 72 hours will no longer process those who\r<br>are crossing the border. Texas will simply load them onto buses and\r<br>ship them to the exact neighborhood of every Democrat Senator and I do\r<br>not mean their DC address. Wherever they come from in their state 800\r<br>illegal immigrants will be dropped in their very neighborhood or as\r<br>close as you can get to their actual residence. 40,000 should do it.\r<br>That&#39;s 800 per Democrat Senator and 1,600 to Chuck Schumer&#39;s home\r<br>neighborhood address. This has become the Achilles Heal and they will\r<br>know that the only way to get them out is if Trump gets them out; as\r<br>Biden&#39;s track record shows he is not capable of the mass exodus which\r<br>President Trump will begin upon being sworn in. At this time those who\r<br>are presently coming forth for the position of Speaker can become\r<br>President Trump&#39;s Speaker of the House. And we can get to the business\r<br>of setting things right.\r<br>\r<br> Herbert Eric Stephens\r<br>\r<br> PART 5. The fastest way to restore President Trump to his rightful\r<br>office as Commander in Chief is through making him Speaker! If you\r<br>truly are in favor of saving these United States of America, then why\r<br>would you wait for another rigged, computer generated election; when\r<br>President Trump will end all elections being conducted with computer\r<br>technology. He will mandate 1 day, 1 vote, paper ballot, results same\r<br>day. Without this, we will never have a fair election in this country\r<br>again. Warnock Cheated, Fetterman Cheated, need I go on? Those two\r<br>alone have changed the course of the United States and not for the\r<br>good! Republicans must do this now! Texas Must Begin Loading The Buses\r<br>Today. The illegals must be in place by Wednesday October 11, 2023 the\r<br>day of RECKONING!\r<br>\r<br>Herbert Eric Stephens\r<br>\r<br>\r<br>PART 6. Regarding the situation that seems to exist in the House\r<br>respecting the issue of someone having a felony not being able to be\r<br>Speaker. This was thought by the Democrats in advance of attempting to\r<br>cut off all access to levers of power that have the propensity to\r<br>propel President Trump back to the Presidency. First rule of business\r<br>on Tuesday is a vote to vacate that rule. It must be unanimous on the\r<br>Republican side of the aisle. This will then allow the party to freely\r<br>pursue the Speakership in any way they see fit and timely. Meanwhile,\r<br>the President can act as Speaker and fast track the Impeachments of\r<br>Biden / Harris.\r<br>\r<br> Herbert Eric Stephens\r<br>\r<br>PART 7. Today 10/07/2023, every spare bus that is available to travel\r<br>to the state of Texas should render itself to the Texas Border. The\r<br>mass shipment of 800 illegal unregistered Border Hoppers should be\r<br>loaded up with zero paperwork, nor supplies and dropped at the door\r<br>step of every Democrat Senator that has an impeachment vote that is\r<br>coupled with removal. 40,000 should do it and if there are any\r<br>Republican or Independants who may be inclined to not vote for the\r<br>&quot;Impeachment &amp; Removal &#39;&#39; of Biden &amp; Harris for violation of the\r<br>Constitution regarding the invasion of our southern border. An extra\r<br>10,000 should be on standby for delivery to those residents as well.\r<br>Once Mr. Trump becomes President these will be the first to be removed\r<br>and shipped to the other side of the Rio Grande! This must be done as\r<br>it is the only thing that will assure a Removal Vote which will be\r<br>forced by the constituents of these Democrat Senators.\r<br>Herbert Eric Stephens\r<br>\r<br>PART 8. It is most imperative that President Trump be made Speaker on\r<br>the first Ballot. Israel is now at war, Russia / Ukraine at war, China\r<br>off the coast of Taiwan, and there is only one man who can stop this.\r<br>President Trump. Though he has no desire to be Speaker long term, in\r<br>the short run, it is necessary that he ascend to the Presidency now\r<br>versus a 13 months election and another 50 -60 day wait to assume the\r<br>office. Jim Jordan I applaud his stance where he has stated that if\r<br>President Trump &quot;needs&quot; the Speakership he may have it. I am not aware\r<br>of how others feel. Just know that on the first ballot it is\r<br>imperative that President Trump be given the opportunity with zero\r<br>resistance; to begin putting in place the mechanisms necessary to\r<br>install him to his rightful place as leader of the free world as\r<br>President of the United States. The Biden / Harris fast track to\r<br>removal needs to be immediate and swift! Everything else can be sorted\r<br>out once President Trump is RESTORED!\r<br>H E S\r<br>\r<br>PART 9. Based on the conscience of the responses I have received on\r<br>the first 8 PARTS of this message to the House of Representatives; I\r<br>can confidently say with all certainty that the American People have\r<br>massively decided that they want President Donald John Trump back in\r<br>the White House via the SPEAKER option. We call on Steve Scalise &amp; Jim\r<br>Jordan to Nominate and 2nd the appointment as SPEAKER Donald John\r<br>Trump. With regard to these two Patriots agreeing this is best not\r<br>just for Country; but for the world; it is extra important for all\r<br>incumbrances regarding the legal question of a proposed existing\r<br>felony which Mr. Trump is currently experiencing; these rules must be\r<br>stayed and or reversed before his installment. The world is on fire\r<br>and only one man knows with absolute certainty where to point the hose\r<br>first. Mr. Scalise &amp; Mr. Jordan, may continue their desired assent to\r<br>Speakership; once all imperative business has been completed! For the\r<br>American People,\r<br>\r<br>Herbert Eric Stephens', '😮😮😢😢', '😢', 'I am so glad Steve dropped out.He is a Rino.', 'no to Ukr', 'Jim Jordan Won', 'DOUBLE AGENT ! JUST LIKE MCARTHY ! THIS IS ALL THEATER, DEMORATS WILL TAKE THE SEAT, IRAN IS ANOTHER DISTRACTION,  P H UCKING PATHETIC POLITICIANS.', 'If you do not put Jim Jordan in as Speaker you will  be going against the People.', 'A black man from New Orleans Steve is racist', 'And scalise puts a muzzle on...not a good omen', 'Fake news', 'Why the f is he wearing a muzzle?

What about the invasion on our southern border ?', 'Agh these guys could fuck up a wet dream! It should’ve been Jim Jordan. This is why people hate both parties. You just put a new RINO in there!

He is authentic.  He is just like everyone else his money and fame has not gone to his head and made him a snob.  I love Trump.  He has proven to me to be someone of statue and is knowledgeable beyond his years.  He has proven his faith in God and speaks freely of his faith.  His knowledge is exactly what we need from the ones leading us to victory.  Our country was great when he was leading us.  And all the while he was making America great, he was being attacked by Obama,  Hillary, Biden, and Pelosi.   He handled all of it with stride. He kept going helping us in every way he could.  This pissed off all those that wanted controll of our country so they could run it in to the ground,  like they are doing.  Our world is so in trouble from these that do have control of our country.   And it is easy for me to see their intentions.   With what Biden has done to our country and to our allies is deplorable.  His actions need to be stopped.  He has made a mockery of our democracy and our justice system.  And is using our departments of justice to go after our citizens to simply jail them so they can stay in power.  Our country is slowly being changed in ways to only benefit those in power.  Our people believe every lie that comes out Biden&#39;s mouth.  He has convinced many that Trump is bad for our country.   When it is he that has went against our God and is helping our enemies. He has started two wars and means to start another when our enemies get situated in our country from coming in over our borders.  All that is happening is in direct response from what Biden has done.  And he lies to us of it and takes no blame for it either. I do not believe him and know that he means to harm each and everyone of us.  By helping our enemies and taking  from us.  He has shut down the pipeline.  He has started two wars.  He has almost shut down all our automobile factories and is still going.  What can people think about his motives with all this happening? The only one that can save us and our country is being falsely accused and charged with insurrection when it is Biden that is committing the insurrection. I can keep going as to what else Biden has done but we all know.  Biden and his administration all kept blaming Trump for almost getting us in a war.  But look now Biden has started two wars.  What are we to believe?  Are we to believe Trump did all this crap to our country?  Ate we to believe that Biden has no fault in what he has done? That is insane just like Biden staying in office after what he and his administration has done.   I don&#39;t care what anyone says about Trump being that crazy and against us.   When we know it has been Biden lead by Obama and Hillary.   Come on people, what kind of country do we want to live in?  One filled with suffering and crying and  starving when our president is giving our enemies food and aid?  This is our highest office punishing us for having much more than the rest of the world.

He gave you a mind to cultivate and use to the best of your ability to serve yourself, your family, and your community at your highest capability. As influencers of your male children, what do you teach them ? Why is your intellect a threat in your culture ?<br>Women all over the world especially American descendants of slavery who are blessed to have survived and maintain to this day a sense of God and self -they fought -enraged with so many dying -and learned eventually to contend in silence while stepping and fetching; they sought refuge to live for another day. Praise God. <br>-just as you steal away to learn today. Many today  were not able to rise and develop as quickly as those who currently experience wealth and success. Out of desperation; like crabs in a barrel there is, and has been a tremendous amount of black on black crime. Many struggle and  succumb to  the generational destruction of their humanity, the lost of identity, the lost of their native language, and to the stripping of their of cultural roots. All this occurring while existing under constant threats of death and torture for merely taking the opportunity to learn and seek justice. Ignorance is poison. Fear is of the devil, it is vapid and feeble. The dissemination of documented brutality practiced against African American people cannot be discounted. There was an attempt for everything humane to be stripped from them. To acclimate to a foreign tongue and subjected to brutality at every turn, out of rape to birth mulatto bastards and then match them with other mulatto bastards to create a whole new group of undercover white looking black people to infiltrate the white self-entitled colonizer system to disarm and  change the narrative toward civil rights. God is.  What Satan used to harm us, God used to reward us. True is the rationale that slavery resulted in stymied social development and dysfunction, but Black people  are the evidence of God’s presence.  In a poet’s words, “You may kill me with your hatefulness, but like air; Still I rise”.<br>God is unchanging. Black men were shackled-dehumanized-crushed, castrated, and hung from trees-while their women were disrespected, separated as children, little girls at 10-12 years old were raped, designated breeders, beaten, killed, and abused by people claiming to be civilized and Christian. These evil colonizers and capitalist bred new slaves to maintain a free labor force.<br>My God has nothing to do with their self entitled bullying and savagery toward others. Jim Crow laws were used against black people to control the morale and grouping together toward self elevation.<br> It is the same train of thought that makes it illegal for you to be educated in your country. This fear is of the adversary. This band  is ungodly to keep you from learning. It is wrong. These men are family and they criminalize educated women.., why ?  At least you are not totally enslaved. It is not a result of  immigrants from across the seas marauding, pillaging, murdering -using a germicidal contagion, and then kidnapping people from another continent to work for free. What you are enduring is not on the scale of the  African American experience by no means. The holocaust of the American aboriginals is exemplary is not recognized as the travesty that it was and the generational harm it did on this land called America. It is unfortunate…<br>Life ain’t been no crystal stair. Today  <br>in America, Black people exist within systematic racism.  This difficult struggle,  excruciating growing pains to fight the proselytizing of the shame of being black and not white. Self-hate and shame was elaborately encoded, ingrained,  and a forcible indoctrination to brainwash blacks into servitude. Black features of thick lips, extremely coiled hair, thick thighs and hips, defined muscularity were God given attributes that were ridiculed and ostracized. For Black people to overcome and continue to exist as a people, they must conquer these issues<br>from the psychological self esteem  damages of slavery. <br>As instruments of God, may you be safe<br>as you continue to learn and stand for the right to be educated. Presently, locked out of society- it is Chi Na  our Scenic-with no identity base; orphans are purposely miseducated. Encrypted education used like Jim Crow laws here in America enslaves zygoted, displaced individuals and allows inhumanity to be legally perpetrated against those designated as “Left-Handed” maligned Manchurian candidates. These people who are purposely sidetracked and railroaded in glass houses are discriminated against. These people are subjected to miseducation, purposely given a handicap, a medical block to display them as mentally ill- or as a threat  to expose the rapes, the emotional and physical abuse that they have experienced at the hands of guilty sociopaths. It is hard for the disadvantaged.  Continue and remain to<br>Be Brave. Trust in God. I believe in Jesus,  we are all human.
