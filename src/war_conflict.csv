The speech by President Joe Biden, focusing heavily on condemning Hamas and expressing unwavering support for Israel, without proportionately addressing the civilian casualties and suffering on the Palestinian side. While it&#39;s crucial to condemn acts of violence and terrorism by any group, it&#39;s equally important to acknowledge the plight and suffering of innocent civilians, regardless of their nationality or ethnicity.

Acts of violence and terrorism by any party should be unequivocally condemned. Both Israel and Palestine should take measures to prevent attacks against civilians and work towards a lasting peace.

hjFeFIG4bks,Retired colonel explains how Hamas caught Israel off-guard during attack,CNN,15700000,586255,4417,900,"['✓ I believe we are meant to be like Jesus in our hearts and not in our flesh. But be careful of AI (Artificial Intelligence), for it is just our flesh and that is it. It knows only things of the flesh (our fleshly desires) and cannot comprehend things of the spirit such as peace of heart (which comes from obeying God&#39;s Word). Whereas we are a spirit and we have a soul but live in the body (in the flesh). When you go to bed it is your flesh that sleeps but your spirit never sleeps (otherwise you have died physically) that is why you have dreams. More so, true love that endures and last is a thing of the heart (when I say &#39;heart&#39;, I mean &#39;spirit&#39;). But fake love, pretentious love, love with expectations, love for classic reasons, love for material reasons and love for selfish reasons that is a thing of our flesh. In the beginning God said let us make man in our own image, according to our likeness. Take note, God is Spirit and God is Love. As Love He is the source of it. We also know that God is Omnipotent, for He creates out of nothing and He has no beginning and has no end. That means, our love is but a shadow of God&#39;s Love. True love looks around to see who is in need of your help, your smile, your possessions, your money, your strength, your quality time. Love forgives and forgets. Love wants for others what it wants for itself. Take note, love works in conjunction with other spiritual forces such as faith and patience. We should let the Word of God be the standard of our lives not AI. If not, God will let us face AI on our own and it will cast the truth down to the ground, it will be the cause of so much destruction like never seen before, it will deceive many and take many captive in order to enslave them into worshipping it and abiding in lawlessness. We can only destroy ourselves but with God all things are possible. God knows us better because He is our Creater and He knows our beginning and our end. Our prove text is taken from the book of John 5:31-44, 2 Thessalonians 2:1-12, Daniel 7-9, Revelation 13-15, Matthew 24-25 and Luke 21. Let us watch and pray...

Let me first caution you.<br>When Bill Clinton was running for office three men went into a room.<br>Their names were Carvel, Morris, &amp; Stephonopholis. When they exited<br>that room they came out with a mantra that the Democrats have lived by<br>using in the form of manipulation. They way they get their way which<br>is to have the general public at large stymied to the point of frankly<br>put, almost zero resistance. Now these lowly House Republicans have<br>just come forth and used this same tactic on the Republican Population<br>of this Country! What were those cherished words, what was the<br>position, and why was this gamble these men took so spot on?\xa0 So Much<br>so,\xa0 they were even amazed at how well it worked! Here&#39;s what they<br>came out of the room with and it was nothing more than a<br>phrase...&quot;WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT&quot;!<br>That&#39;s it, they decided to tell the &quot;American People&quot; &quot;YOU&quot;, and any<br>and all Americans who vote, were going to vote, were going to register<br>to vote; and in places around the country where former voters had laid<br>down and died; they too were not spared on hearing\xa0 &#39;WHAT THE AMERICAN<br>PEOPLE WANT&quot;! Because even the dead would be used to bring home any<br>concept they wanted to bring forward by having the dead continue to<br>vote, and denying &quot;Alive Voters&quot; to be in charge of casting their own<br>vote! Republicans are still lying about the outcome of the 2020<br>Election and the Democrats are happy and willing to oblige by agreeing<br>with them. They do not want to be truthful at all. Especially since<br>&quot;WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE REALLY WANT IS DONALD JOHN TRUMP BACK IN HIS<br>RIGHTFUL EARNED 2020 ELECTION VICTORY THAT WAS STOLEN BY THE DEMOCRATS<br>AND STILL LIED ABOUT BY MANY REPUBLICANS&#39;&#39;! aLL UNDER THE GUISE OF<br>THESE rEPUBLICANS STATING THEY ARE UNITED NOW BEHIND THE NE&#39;ER DO WELL<br>FROM lOUISANA! When a reporter asked them about the 20200 Election<br>they all let out a boo and a hiss! Why, because they are heck bent on<br>telling all to the Republicans throughout this great land of ours;<br>which is being overrun by Rape, Robbery, Murder, and do not let me<br>leave out Invasion at the Southern border. I bet you didn&#39;t do the<br>math but there are 5 illegal immigrants crossing the border every<br>single minute of every single day so far this year. That is about<br>7,300 per day. Now I ask you, does this SOFT, looking man from the<br>great state of Louisiana look to you like he is tough enough to take<br>on the world? I think personally if he were in the same room with<br>Putin or the Head guy from China, he would lose control of his<br>sphincter in my humble opinion.<br>So what is this all about, it is about the 118th Congress House<br>Republicans telling you &quot;THE AMERICAN PEOPLE&quot; what you want which is<br>100% false. When what we want is a Pathway to the Presidency for<br>DONALD JOHN TRUMP IMMEDIATELY. Because, think about it for just one<br>moment. If they were truly going to govern like they are attempting to<br>make us believe; then they would have &quot;IMPEACHMENTS OF BIDEN / HARRIS<br>&quot; for violation of the Constitution via invasion at the southern<br>border. Which means the LA Congressman I will call him &quot;Young Softy<br>With the Glasses&quot;; he is going to ascend right to the Presidency and<br>his first meeting with Putin and the China Man.<br>So, based on all Polling Donald John Trump is favored over Biden.<br>Trump took down every person we were able to Poll him against in one<br>on one scenarios for Speaker. We were then kicked off of 3 Social<br>Media Platforms for posting the results via Big Tech algorithms. So<br>what can I tell you about what the &quot;American People Want&quot;? I can tell<br>you they want to Win again.<br>1. Gas Price Lowered to Trump Era Pricing<br>2. To be Energy Independent<br>3. To be returned to Trump Era Food Prices<br>4. To be returned to Trump Era Home Loan Interest Rates<br>5. To be returned to Trump Era Housing Affordability<br>6. To be returned to the Trump Era American Respectability around the world<br>7. To be returned to an Era where Law &amp; Order is Restored to our<br>Cities, Towns, States, and Country<br>8. To be returned to an Era where if someone Murders someone else, and<br>they are guilty as charged, they do time<br>9. To be returned to an Era where you could send your children to<br>school and they learn Cursive, reading, Writing, Math, History; and<br>where they do not learn anything that has to do with the sexualization<br>of children!<br>10. To be returned to an Era where the Congress does the will of the<br>people, and not commit the &quot;THEFT&quot; of the People!<br>In conclusion, the Founding Fathers created a pathway to the<br>Presidency while being as certain as possible that this would position<br>the next best Man to the Presidency.
